-- Let’s apply data intervals for the `person` table. 
-- Please make a SQL statement which returns a person's identifiers, person's names and interval of person’s ages
-- (set a name of a new calculated column as ‘interval_info’) based on pseudo code below. 

--     if (age >= 10 and age <= 20) then return 'interval #1'
--     else if (age > 20 and age < 24) then return 'interval #2'
--     else return 'interval #3'

-- and yes...please sort a result by ‘interval_info’ column in ascending mode.

SELECT id,
	name,
	CASE WHEN age BETWEEN 10 AND 20 THEN 'interval #1' ELSE CASE WHEN age BETWEEN 21 AND 23 THEN 'interval #2' ELSE 'interval #3' END END AS "interval_info"
FROM person
ORDER BY interval_info;
